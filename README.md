# SkillCraft-ML

The SkillCraft dataset is available at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SkillCraft1+Master+Table+Dataset). The original paper by Thompson et al. (2013) can be found as a  PLOS ONE [publication](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075129).

This repo contains Jupyter Notebook code for several experiments on the SkillCraft dataset:

* Two-league neural net classifiers (e.g., predicting [Bronze and Gold players](./SkillCraft_Bronze_Gold.ipynb))
* [Eight-rank](./SkillCraft_Classify_Rank_with_GM.ipynb) neural net classifier
* [Applying PCA](./SkillCraft_PCA.ipynb) and colouring the points based on normalized values of each feature

Any feedback is welcome!
